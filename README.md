# Product Microservice

This microservice can be used to manage the product catalog and obtain product
information. The frontend sends requests to this microservice which then interacts
with the product database. You can get all products or specify just one to get.

This microservice runs on Python Version >3.10.
To install all dependencies, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
You may choose to create a venv for this.
